/**
 * calorie calculation based on @link { https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/Activity-Categories }
 *
 *
 * How do we get to this calculation from the values of the compendium of physical activities?
 * Easy: we have given some points like
 * - 5kmh -> 4 MET or
 * - 8kmh -> 6 MET.
 * Using regression the function "MET = f(speedInKmh)" can be created.
 * That's what you can see below for different activities.
