## Running Project
todo

1. Setup nodejs environment, make sure MongoDB is installed on the computer.

2. Run the project

```bash
npm run start-all
```

This command will start up frontend and backend at the same time so you don't need to cd to different folder to start them seperately.

Or if you are running the project first time:

```bash
npm run start-all-first-time
```
This command will install all needed package for frontend and backend as well as starting up them at the same time

3. If the command above doesn't work, then you needed to install the packages and start up frontend and backend manually

Run the command below to start frontend
```bash
npm install #(only if you are running the project at the first time)
npm run start
```

then cd to `server` folder, run the command below to start backend
```bash
npm install #(only if you are running the project at the first time)
node server.js
```

### guidelines for implementation
---
1. ui is located in `app\src\main\res`, feel free to modify the corresponding part for the project (android studio provides a preview for each ui so it's pretty easy to see the actual layout)
2. logic/event related to ui components are located in `app\src\main\java\..\..\..`, need to add event corresponding to the newly added ui component here.
